# My Game List
*My Game List* is a web app that aims to make tracking your video game collection easier. MGL lets you keep track of the games you've finished, games you're currently playing, or even ones you haven't started yet. With each game entry, you're able to create notes, rate the game, and even upload screenshots of your gameplay. MGL uses the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started) to pull video game data, which allows users to search for a specific game.

## Technology Used
